## Leaf - game rules

In a map of Liège, there will be trees. Each tree as a _value_ (which is the product of his _diameter_ by his _height_, *rounded to top*). 

> This value will use the "leaf" as unit. For instance, a tree of 9m of diameter and 17.3m of size will have a value of (`9 × 17.3 = 155.7 ≈ 156`) **156 leaves**.

When a player enter the game, he needs to create an account, will choose a color, and will receive three random, *free* trees (and some bonus leaves, following the formula: `[total leaves of players] / [amount of players]`).  
Every fifteen minutes **in real life**, each player will receive an amount of leaves equals to the total of each of his trees.  
Every hour **in real life**, each player loose half his leaves.

Whenever he wants, a player can _buy_ a tree.
